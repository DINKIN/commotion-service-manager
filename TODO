TODO
test avahi client while restarting avahi daemon
configure which interface(s) to listen on
make note in README that version, lifetime, key, and signature are required fields in the schema
service updates registration/subscription and notifications for clients
UCI-defaults script
	delete /etc/avahi/services/*
	for all local==1 apps in UCI, s/fingerprint/key and re-create signatures using alpha ordering of txt fields
	s/type/tag
	need to convert UUID?
unit tests
pull in gtest via makefile, don't include in repo
pare down header includes
code cleanup
update README

DONE
hook on service commit/change to write out to UCI
convert services and service lists into commotion objects
update UCI functions to not use txt_lst
actually multicast added apps
change UUID calculation in luci-commotion-apps
	UUID should be base32 encoding of key
	for version 1.0 remote services, calculate UUID as hash of concat of URI, key
add version property to services
redo print services
finish client commands
replace avahi_malloc/avahi_strdup w/ halloc
input validation in commotion-service-manager.c (set functions), CMD(commit_service) in main.c
update get_uuid function
  - pass buffer instead of mallocing string in function
use i->host_name in get_uuid, instead of using local box's hostname
TTL field isn't functional for CSM, so remove it from csm_service_t
write schema-generic setters/getters in service.h/c
ctx should have all available versions of schema (maybe linked list with most recent first?)
convert functions to use schema system: _csm_extract_from_txt_list, _csm_create_signing_template, csm_update_service, csm_publish_service, cmd_commit_service, uci_read, uci_write
make csm_schema_t a co_list since it will need to be sent to clients
client API should have standard error return value
Add CSM API method for fetching schema
add "generated" option to schema fields, so while required for remote services, locally created services don't have to provide them when committing
don't hardcode service protocol, instead make runtime protocol configuration using config file
create error/return code enum and use that for all return code checking
redo commotion-service-manager.h/c to use schema
validate service fields so length of "<field name>=<field value>" < 256
