comparison of new service against schema should happen in service_commit in commotion-service-manager.c and csm_add_service/csm_update_service in service_list.h
move create/verify signature to service_list.h/c since it will need ctx.schema
replace fields object with another list object
would be nice to allow additional non-spec fields to be included
verifying signatures will be separate from schemas. it will simply order fields (and elements of list fields) alphabetically and create signing template
schema versions will be semantic versioning. CSMs using schemas with different major version numbers will reject announcements from each other, while same major version numbers will attempt to be forward and backward compatible. For forward compatibility, it will use the current schema version it has (so new minor revisions can only add additional fields). For backward compatibility, it will either find its copy of the schema of that version or use the next closest version it has.

TODO
put input validation in service setter functions, instead of in update_service()
don't hardcode service protocol, instead make runtime protocol configuration using config file
  convert functions to use schema: _csm_extract_from_txt_list, cmd_commit_service, csm_publish_service, _csm_create_signing_template, uci_read, uci_write, print_service, csm_update_service
  redo commotion-service-manager.h/c to use schema
create error/return code enum and use that for all return code checking
  (and create same for libcommotion return/error codes)
service updates registration/subscription and notifications for clients
UCI-defaults script
	delete /etc/avahi/services
	read all local==1 apps in UCI to lua tables, remove all UCI apps, import lua tables into CSM (which will write out to UCI)
	need to convert UUID
unit tests
pull in gtest via makefile, don't include in repo
pare down header includes
code cleanup
update README

DONE
hook on service commit/change to write out to UCI
convert services and service lists into commotion objects
update UCI functions to not use txt_lst
actually multicast added apps
change UUID calculation in luci-commotion-apps
	UUID should be base32 encoding of key
	for version 1.0 remote services, calculate UUID as hash of concat of URI, key
add version property to services
redo print services
finish client commands
replace avahi_malloc/avahi_strdup w/ halloc
input validation in commotion-service-manager.c (set functions), CMD(commit_service) in main.c
update get_uuid function
  - pass buffer instead of mallocing string in function
use i->host_name in get_uuid, instead of using local box's hostname
TTL field isn't functional for CSM, so remove it from csm_service_t
write schema-generic setters/getters in service.h/c
ctx should have all available versions of schema (maybe linked list with most recent first?)
