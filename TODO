get required fields
create signing template
get/set fields according to list/non-list
validate fields
replace fields object with another list object
would be nice to allow additional non-spec fields to be included

TODO
put input validation in service setter functions, instead of in update_service()
don't hardcode service protocol, instead make runtime protocol configuration using config file
  convert functions to use schema: _csm_extract_from_txt_list, cmd_commit_service, csm_publish_service, _csm_create_signing_template, uci_read, uci_write
  redo commotion-service-manager.h/c to use schema
  write generic setters/getters in service.h/c
create error/return code enum and use that for all return code checking
  (and create same for libcommotion return/error codes)
service updates registration/subscription and notifications for clients

replace avahi_malloc/avahi_strdup w/ halloc
input validation in commotion-service-manager.c (set functions), CMD(commit_service) in main.c
