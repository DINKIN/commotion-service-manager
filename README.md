Commotion Service Manager
=========================

The Commotion Service Manager publishes, receives, parses, verifies, and caches service announcements on a local Commotion mesh network. It implements a multicast DNS (mDNS) stack using the [Avahi][] library, and uses the [commotiond][] API for cryptographically signing and verifying service announcements.
