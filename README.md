Commotion Service Manager
=========================

The Commotion Service Manager receives, parses, verifies, and caches service announcements on a local Commotion mesh network. It implements an multicast DNS (mDNS) stack using the [Avahi][] library, and uses the [Serval][]-crypto API for verifying signed service announcements.
